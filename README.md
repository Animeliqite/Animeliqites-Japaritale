### FAQ

**Q: How do I contribute?**

A: It is pretty simple. You can either do prototypes of necessary things as stated in the DEMO Roadmap or suggest features of any kinds (music, code, bug-fixes, sprites, etc.) and of what you'd prefer even outside of the roadmap. With proper credit, create mods using the source code if you want to, it'd be likely I wouldn't care.

**Q: Am I going to be credited in the game?**

A: Definitely! In fact, I'll try to make a system that reads a .TXT file and writes it into the credits.

**Q: I've made an asset contribution. Where do I place it?**

A: If it's an executable tool, it must go to "External Tools" section. Otherwise, "Assets" section would be the best.

**Q: I want to make a discussion. Where do I do it?**

A: Create a discussion topic in "Discussions". I'll try my best to reply.

### Summary
