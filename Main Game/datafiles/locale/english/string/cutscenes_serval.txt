"cutscene.cellien.serval.save.0"		"* That voice!"
"cutscene.cellien.serval.save.1"		"* Myamyamyamya~!"
"cutscene.cellien.serval.save.2"		"* Uh... Don't worry!&* You're in safe hands now!"
"cutscene.cellien.serval.save.3"		"* There we go!"

"cutscene.serval.greet.0"			"* Oh dear, I'm glad&  youâ€™re awake!"
"cutscene.serval.greet.1"			"* It was very unnerving&  for me to see you like&  this!"
"cutscene.serval.greet.2"			"* That numbness of yours&  has frightened me even&  more!"
"cutscene.serval.greet.3"			"* I hope I was able to&  make you feel better&  after all this."
"cutscene.serval.greet.4"			"* Yes?"
"cutscene.serval.greet.5"			"* Ahhh... I can feel my&  capabilities already&  paying off!"
"cutscene.serval.greet.6"			"* Now tell me, what kind&  of a FRIEND are you?"
"cutscene.serval.greet.7"			"* You... don't even know?"
"cutscene.serval.greet.8"			"* There isn't any need to&  worry since the Japari&  Library exists!"
"cutscene.serval.greet.9"			"* It'll take you moments&  to traverse through&  areas and that's it."
"cutscene.serval.greet.10"			"* Although I can only&  guide you throughout&  this very place, but..."
"cutscene.serval.greet.11"			"* Come on, if you will,&  together let's march&  forward!"

"cutscene.serval.new_friend.0"			"* Hey look!&* Over there!"
"cutscene.serval.new_friend.1"			"* It appears I forgot&  to introduce you to&  the folk around here."
"cutscene.serval.new_friend.2"			"* And Zebra-chan is an&  example you've just&  seen over that spot."
"cutscene.serval.new_friend.3"			"* Though don't worry,&  as all the Friends&  here are harmless."
"cutscene.serval.new_friend.4"			"* Why don't you have&  a little conversation&  with her?"
"cutscene.serval.new_friend.5"			"* I'll be waiting here."

"cutscene.serval.post_convo.0"			"* You had quite a decent&  conversation there!"
"cutscene.serval.post_convo.1"			"* Thinking about how I had&  to get you to the&  library..."
"cutscene.serval.post_convo.2"			"* I think it'd better to&  move on to our mission."
"cutscene.serval.post_convo.3"			"* So, yeah!&* Let's go!"

"cutscene.serval.mountain.0"			"* Look!"
"cutscene.serval.mountain.1"			"* That's one big mountain&  we can clearly gaze&  upon!"
"cutscene.serval.mountain.2"			"* Recently, a \"{color `yellow`}SANDSTAR{color `white`}\"&  came out from that&  mountain."
"cutscene.serval.mountain.3"			"* Maybe... that's where&  you were born?"
"cutscene.serval.mountain.4"			"* I'm starting to wonder&  about the CELLIENS&  actually."

"cutscene.savannah.lake.0"			"* The water looks so delightful I&  cannot tolerate taking a sip."
"cutscene.savannah.lake.1"			"* Threathening the safety of&  my property, I see?"
"cutscene.savannah.lake.2"			"* You know what happens to&  beings like you?"
"cutscene.savannah.lake.3"			"* They experience death."
"cutscene.savannah.lake.4"			"* Hippo! &* Stop."
"cutscene.savannah.lake.5"			"* I cannot allow such&  things like this&  to KABAN!"
"cutscene.savannah.lake.6"			"* Ooh~!{w}&* You've got yourself a&  companion, I see~"
"cutscene.savannah.lake.7"			"* ..."
"cutscene.savannah.lake.8"			"* Oh, I'm sorry~!{w}&* Does my \"lascivious\" voice&  bother you two~?"
"cutscene.savannah.lake.9"			"* Well, I'm used to your{w}&  \"weird\" voice, to be&  honest..."
"cutscene.savannah.lake.10"			"* Good, good~!"
"cutscene.savannah.lake.11"			"* Anyways, I was going&  to ask you why you&  put KABAN in such fear."
"cutscene.savannah.lake.12"			"* Those little creatures&  were bothering me off, thus&  I wasn't morally fine."
"cutscene.savannah.lake.13"			"* Though look out for the&  huge CELLIEN halting&  the gate."
"cutscene.savannah.lake.14"			"* You two wouldn't be&  able to beat it&  anyway~!"
"cutscene.savannah.lake.15"			"* Then why not do it&  yourself?"
"cutscene.savannah.lake.16"			"* I have \"bathing\" stuff to do&  right now~..."
"cutscene.savannah.lake.17"			"* ..."
"cutscene.savannah.lake.18"			"* Anyways, we've got&  things to do!"
"cutscene.savannah.lake.19"			"* Don't you think your&  little \"companion\" needs&  to take cover?"
"cutscene.savannah.lake.20"			"* Hippo, please."
"cutscene.savannah.lake.21"			"* It seems you've forgotten&  the rules of Japari Park&  as well, huh~?"
"cutscene.savannah.lake.22"			"*{voice -1} ............"
"cutscene.savannah.lake.23"			"* S-she is more capable&  than you think!"
"cutscene.savannah.lake.24"			"* Well then.{w}&* We'll see what this&  fella has got~!"
"cutscene.savannah.lake.25"			"* So, are you able to swim?"
"cutscene.savannah.lake.26"			"* No?"
"cutscene.savannah.lake.27"			"* Well, how about running&  fast?"
"cutscene.savannah.lake.28"			"* Unfortunate..."
"cutscene.savannah.lake.29"			"* What about flying?"
"cutscene.savannah.lake.30"			"* Well, you shouldn't let&  your hopes too high, Serval~."
"cutscene.savannah.lake.31"			"* You wouldn't want to leave&  a child like this alone&  in a conflict, would you?"
"cutscene.savannah.lake.32"			"* And thus, why don't I teach&  you two how to sprint?"
"cutscene.savannah.lake.33"			"* Teaching!? &* I don't think--"
"cutscene.savannah.lake.34"			"* Laziness won't work in a&  situation like this, Serval.{w}&* It is important."
"cutscene.savannah.lake.35"			"* (Here we go again...)"
"cutscene.savannah.lake.36"			"* Well then!&* Get ready for a minute-long&  lesson!"
"cutscene.savannah.lake.37"			"* I eagerly listened to Hippo's&  words and learned something&  new as a result."
"cutscene.savannah.lake.38"			"* This technique will surely&  boost my skills in a fight."
"cutscene.savannah.lake.39"			"* I've mastered the \"{color `yellow`}RUNNING{color `white`}\" &  technique!"
"cutscene.savannah.lake.40"			"* This...{w} did NOT go well."
"cutscene.savannah.lake.41"			"* I mean, at least Kaban&  knows something valuable&  now."
"cutscene.savannah.lake.42"			"* You don't have to be biased&  for that little advice, &  you know."
"cutscene.savannah.lake.43"			"* Uh,{w} let's just go."
