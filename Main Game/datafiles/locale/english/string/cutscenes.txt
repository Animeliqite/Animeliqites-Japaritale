"cutscene.zebra.conversation.5.alt.alt"		"And how it's the only&place to live in...?"
"cutscene.zebra.conversation.6.alt.alt"		"Someone has been&searching for someone&like you..."
"cutscene.zebra.conversation.7.alt.alt"		"She explained about&her hat being stolen,&and..."
"cutscene.zebra.conversation.8.alt.alt"		"Although she seems to&be misunderstanding&about you..."
"cutscene.zebra.conversation.9.alt.alt"		"You've got to keep&yourself safe, you&know?"
